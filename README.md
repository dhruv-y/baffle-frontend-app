# Front-End App for Baffle

## Description

The project is divided into 3 higher level components - Pokemon Types, All Pokemon, and Favorites. State is primarily managed through the Context-API and files for the global state, actions, and reducers can be found in folder 'context' and 'reducers'. All other components are managed within the 'components' folder. While the app meets all of the acceptance criteria, it also :- 

    • Implements data persistence through localStorage
    • Uses custom SCSS components over libraries like MaterialUI or Bootstrap
    • Manages state using the context-API following the 'Flux' pattern

## Setup

• NPM needs to be installed in your environment as a prerequisite for development purposes.

• Clone the repo and install node_modules by running

    `npm install`

• To start the app, navigate to the root and run

    `npm start`
